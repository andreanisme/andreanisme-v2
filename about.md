###ABOUT###

My name is Andrean Saputro, and I’m a front-end web developer. I’m intrigued by the stories behind objects; how they were made, and who made them. I like to make tools for the web and write about technology, design, life, courage, and lack thereof (in minor perspective, yes, often). I also like Disney, dogs, and looking up.

I’m currently working in Jakarta as a Front-end Web Developer. If you want to, you can view [my résumé](http://id.linkedin.com/in/andreanisme/ "Andrean Saputro's Linkedin").

I say words on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/andreanisme "Twitter"). I connect with my family on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/andrean). I enjoy many geek's GIF on [Google+](http://plus.google.com/117523789598736054798 "Andrean Saputro's Google Plus"). Read inspiring story on [Medium](https://medium.com/@andreanisme "Post on Medium.com"). Listening and make cool music playlist on [Deezer](http://www.deezer.com/profile/453585722 " Deezer").  Nothing out of the ordinary.
